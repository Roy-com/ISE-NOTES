          Industrial and System Engineering is the best branch of IIT KHARAGPUR
          among all the non-circuital branches. Its flexibility allows you to
          pursue anything you want: Core, Non-core, Culture(legit
          everything).Finance, Coding, Data Analytics, Supply Chain | Our
          syllabus touches everything and lays a good foundation. So after that,
          you can pursue anything in which your interest arises.

        <h3 class="question">
          1. What is the Industrial & Systems Engineering core curriculum like?
        </h3>
        <p class="ans">
          Industrial and Systems are the two terms that come to mind. The goal
          of engineering is to improve the efficiency of an industry's
          operations. It's more of a crossroads between Computer Science and
          Management. Product Development, Process Planning, and Operation
          Resources are taught on one hand, and Python, Optimizing Codes, and
          Procedural Programming are taught on the other. We have a couple of
          Mechanical Department courses as well, but only the fascinating and
          applied ones, not the fundamental, theoretical mechanical courses. We
          have a lot of term projects, so we get to do a lot of hands-on
          learning and research.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="borderqans">
        <h3 class="question">
          2. What is the structure/schedule of the course? Which semesters
          necessitate more work and attention? How difficult is it to maintain a
          respectable grade point average while participating in extracurricular
          activities?
        </h3>
        <p class="ans">
          The programme is laid-back and unhurried. It is possible to engage in
          extracurricular activities while keeping a good CGPA. Probability and
          statistics are heavily emphasised in the curriculum. There are some
          theory classes available, but not many. The majority of courses are
          mathematical, logical, or analytical in nature. The third semester is
          the busiest of them all. However, during your second year, you'll have
          a better sense of what's going on and how to plan properly. The
          fundamental courses appear in the 5th and 6th semesters and are simple
          to comprehend and pass.

        <h3 class="question">
          3. What are the research areas in IM? What are some reputable MS/Ph.D.
          programmes that accept freshmen around the world?
        </h3>
        <p class="ans">
          MS programmes in Industrial & Systems Engineering have a lot of
          potential in the United States. In reality, it is on a par with
          Computer Science and Electrical Engineering research. Industrial is
          also a chosen branch for study in general. Our curriculum is heavily
          influenced by Georgia Institute of Technology's Industrial and Systems
          Engineering programme, which is regarded as one of the best in the
          country. As a result, our curriculum improves our chances of getting
          included in the transcript. Math, Data Analytics, Relative
          Maintenance, and Supply Chain Management are among the most common
          research topics.

        <h3 class="question">
          4. What are the job options for someone who is interested in the field
          but does not want to pursue an MS/Ph.D. after college? What are the
          most important courses for CDC Internships and Placements?
        </h3>
        <p class="ans">
          There are some companies in CDC that are available expressly for
          Chemical, Mechanical, and Industrial graduates, but they tend to
          favour chemical and mechanical grads more than us, and they especially
          overlook students with poor CGPAs. Core supply chain businesses, ITC,
          and P&G are just a few of them.<br /><br />These businesses offer
          supply chain management and product development projects, which are
          ideal for a curriculum like ours, but unfortunately, these businesses
          haven't yet formed this understanding, as seen by the fact that they
          didn't open for Industrial until a year ago. As a result, I wouldn't
          put too much faith in CDC because the prospects are limited. There is
          a glimpse of optimism with the emergence of companies like Udaan, but
          the future remains uncertain. Getting an FT is the best option.<br /><br />Probability
          and Statistics is the most significant topic, however other areas such
          as Information Systems and Operations Research are also covered.
          People are mostly recruited into open to everyone enterprises or
          software sectors, as I've noticed. As a result, the core prospects for
          core profiles in CDC are limited.

        <h3 class="question">
          5. What degree of adaptability is there in the curriculum? What
          courses should you choose for a minor or micro, and how should you
          supplement your core curriculum with subjects from other departments?
        </h3>
        <p class="ans">
          Because we don't have a lot of subject-based assignments like Computer
          Science or Electrical Engineering, most students in our department
          take additionals from other departments. This gives us a lot of time
          to do other things. We don't even receive a lot of lab work.
          Everything is done largely in the lab and takes very little time. The
          majority of these assignments are done in groups.<br /><br />People
          usually take minor/micro-courses from the Departments of Computer
          Science and Mathematics. If you're doing a four-year programme, you'll
          need to put in a lot of extra time to finish CSE minors. The Maths
          minor, on the other hand, is less difficult to finish. If you're doing
          a dual degree, you won't have any problems because you'll have plenty
          of time in your fourth and fifth years to complete minor curricular
          courses.

        <h3 class="question">
          6. What is the CDC intern's situation in the Industrial Department?
          How difficult is it to get a full-time position at a reputable
          university?
        </h3>
        <div class="ans">
          Securing an FT is largely on on individual initiative; the department
          does not have a significant role in the process. It's more about the
          projects you choose and how you complete them in a foreign programme.
          Foreign academics typically take into account your past project
          experience, CG, and they place a high value on perseverance. On
          average, 10–15 percent of a batch's participants receive an FT from
          our department.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="borderqans">
        <h3 class="question">
          7. How does the Dual Degree programme differ from the B.Tech.
          programme?
        </h3>
        <div class="ans">
          It's not that dissimilar. A Dual Degree course does not add to your
          knowledge in any substantial way. It's more about you getting an extra
          year to do some extracurricular activities and find out what you want
          to do. It's not like an M.Tech, where you may study a subject in
          depth. One thing to remember is that while a BTP can be completed in
          any department and on any project of your choice, an MTP must be
          completed within one's own department. This is significant since the
          MTPs and BTPs have close to 25 credits and are extremely essential
          academically.<br /><br />If you want to learn more and go deeper, I
          recommend getting an MS instead of converting to a Dual Degree.
          However, one significant advantage of the Dual Degree programme is
          that in your fifth year, the stipend you get covers practically all of
          your academic expenses.
